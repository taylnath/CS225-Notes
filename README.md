# CS225-Notes
Notes for CS 225. the main project is "cs225_symbols_formulas.pdf", which is a LaTeX version of the original course notes sheet "Notes_symbols_formulas.pdf". You can find the current PDF document (as well as the .tex document)
in the symbols_formulas folder, or [here](symbols_formulas/cs225_symbols_formulas.pdf). You can find the current Chapter 4 Theorems and Definitions document in the ch4_theorems_definitions folder, or [here](ch4_theorems_definitions/cs225_ch4_theorems_definitions.pdf). 

# Versions of the Symbols/Formulas Document:

There have been 3 main versions so far:
- The original version, which was as close to an exact copy of the "Notes_symbols_formulas.pdf" as I could make.
- A version updated by a CS 225 ULA, which includes the negation law(s) (I believe this was the only change). 
- The current version, which has the following changes:
  - Improved spacing for logical statements involving `~`. 
  - The negation law is included with LaTeX code.
  - The summation section now includes all formulas from the "summation_formula_updated.pdf" document from Canvas.

# Versions of the Chapter 4 Theorems and Definitions Document:

This document is meant to be an abbreviated list of Theorems and Definitions from Chapter 4, to make it easier to cite theorems for proofs. It is currently in its first version. There may be typos and / or mistakes included, although I have tried to be as accurate and complete as possible!

# Disclaimer

The css225_symbols_formulas.pdf document is currently being used in the CS225 Canvas course, so I believe statements on it can be cited on homework and quizzes. Any other notes here are not necessarily approved by CS225 instructors, and may possibly contain typos, missing information, or other mistakes.

# Contributing

I want these documents to be used by anyone and everyone in CS225, but I would like to keep track of any updates made so that the files can continue to improve! If you find a typo, find something missing, or have other suggestions for these documents, I would appreciate if you would do one of the following things:

- (preferred) Let me know, and I will change it.
- (preferred) Edit the relevant .tex file and either:
  - (preferred) Make a pull request to this repository with your changes, or
  - Send me a copy of your updated .tex file, and I can merge it with the previous version. 
- Send me a copy of the new document with some notes on what you changed (so I can update the .tex file).
