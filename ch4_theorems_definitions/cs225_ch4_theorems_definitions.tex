\section*{From 4.1:}
\subsection*{Assumptions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Basic laws of algebra from appendix $A$ (I assume we do not have to cite these--I listed some on
    the last page of this document)
    \item Properties of equality: $x = x$, $x = y \implies y = x$, $x = y \text{ and } y = z \implies x = z$
    \item Principle of substitution: if $x = y$, then we can substitute in $y$ wherever $x$ appears. 
    \item The integers are closed under addition, subtraction and multiplication. (The book also 
    mentions that there is no integer between 0 and 1--does that need to be an assumption??)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Definitions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An integer $n$ is {\bf even} if and only if 
    it can be written as $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. 
    \item An integer $n$ is {\bf odd} if and only if 
    it can be written as $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$. 
    \item An integer $n$ is {\bf prime} if and only if 
    $n > 1$ and for all positive integers $r$ and $s$, if 
    $n = rs$, then either $r$ or $s$ equals $n$. 
    \item An integer $n$ is {\bf composite} if and only if
    $n > 1$ and $n = rs$ for some integers $r$ and $s$ with
    $1< r< n$ and $1< s< n$. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Theorem 4.1.1}
The sum of any two even integers is even.

\section*{From 4.3:}
\subsection*{Definition:}
A real number $r$ is {\bf rational} if and only if 
there are integers $a$ and $b$ with $b \neq 0$ so that
$r = \dfrac{a}{b}$

\subsection*{Property:}
The zero product property is: if neither of two 
real numbers is zero, then their product is also not zero. (
    this is T11 in appendix A)

\subsection*{Theorem 4.3.1:}
Every integer is a rational number.

\subsection*{Theorem 4.3.2:}
The sum of any two rational numbers is a rational number. 

\subsection*{Corollary 4.2.3:}
The double of a rational number is a rational number. 

\subsection*{Result of Exercise 12:}
The square of any rational number is a rational number. 

\subsection*{Result of Exercise 13:}
The negative of any rational number is a rational number. 

\subsection*{Result of Exercise 14:}
The cube of any rational number is a rational number. 

\subsection*{Result of Exercise 15:}
The product of any two rational numbers is a rational number. 

\subsection*{Result of Exercise 17:}
The difference of any two rational numbers is a rational number. 

\newpage
\section*{From 4.4:}

\subsection*{Definition:}
If $n$ and $d$ are integers, then $n$ is {\bf divisible by} 
$d$ if and only if $d \neq 0$ and $n = kd$ for some integer 
$k$. 

Some synonyms for ``$d$ divides $n$'':
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n$ is a multiple of $d$
    \item $d$ is a factor of $n$
    \item $d$ is a divisor of $n$
    \item $d$ divides $n$
    \item $d \mid n$
\end{itemize}

The notation $d \nmid n$ means ``$d$ does not divide $n$''. 

\subsection*{Theorem 4.4.1:} 
For all integers $a$ and $b$, if $a$ and $b$ are positive 
and $a$ divides $b$ then $a \leq b$. 

\subsection*{Theorem 4.4.2:}
The only divisors of 1 are 1 and $-1$. 

\subsection*{Theorem 4.4.3:}
For all integers $a,b$ and $c$, if $a$ divides $b$ and $b$ 
divides $c$, then $a$ divides $c$. 

\subsection*{Theorem 4.4.4:}
Any integer $n > 1$ is divisible by a prime number. 

\subsection*{Theorem 4.4.5:}
Given any integer $n > 1$ there exists a positive integer 
$k$, distinct prime numbers $p_1,p_2 \dots, p_k$, 
and positive integers $e_1,e_2, \dots, e_k$ such that
$$
n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \dots p_k^{e_k} = \prod_{i = 1}^k p_i^{e_i}
$$
and any other expression for $n$ as a product of prime numbers 
is identical to this except perhaps for the order in which 
the factors are written. 

\subsection*{Definition:}
Given any integer $n> 1$, the {\bf standard factored form} 
of $n$ is an expression of the form
$$
n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \dots p_k^{e_k} = \prod_{i = 1}^k p_i^{e_i}
$$
where $k$ is a positive integer, $p_1, \dots, p_k$ are 
prime numbers, $e_1, \dots, e_k$ are positive integers, 
and $p_1 < p_2 < \dots < p_k$.

\section*{From 4.7:}

\subsection*{Theorem 4.7.1:}
There is no greatest integer.

\subsection*{Theorem 4.7.2:}
There is no integer that is both even and odd.

\subsection*{Theorem 4.7.3:}
The sum of any rational number and any irrational number is irrational. 

\subsection*{Proposition 4.7.4:}
For every integer $n$, if $n^2$ is even then $n$ is even.

\section*{From 4.8:}

\subsection*{Theorem 4.8.1:}
$\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. 

\subsection*{Proposition 4.8.2:}
$1 + 3 \sqrt{2}$ is irrational. 

\subsection*{Proposition 4.8.3:}
For any integer $a$ and any prime number $p$, if $p \mid a$
then $p \nmid (a + 1)$. 

\subsection*{Theorem 4.8.4:}
The set of prime numbers is infinite (i.e. there are 
infinitely many prime numbers).
